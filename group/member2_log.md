On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week I started looking at Android Studio patterns and Firebase, discussed how should we start and proceed with our project with my group.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week we assigned different classes for each member and I started looking for ways of writing the MainProjectPage class. In addition, I will work on integrating the others' codes to the database with Cem.

### ~ 11.05.2020 ~
This week I kept working on the MainProjectPage class and the buttons are done. The functions of these buttons will cover the rest of my work with the design and database parts.

### ~ 18.05.2020 ~
We met a lot as a group and made the last bits of changes, then we recorded our project demo. I edited the video and uploaded it to Youtube.

### What did I learn?
Although my part of code wasn't very huge, the main struggle was to correctly combine the others' code and to integrate it to Firebase. I learnt features of Firebase and structure of AndroidStudio during the project period, also, this was a great practice for me to organize teammates and work as a group.
