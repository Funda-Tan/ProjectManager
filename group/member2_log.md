On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week I started looking at Android Studio patterns and discussed how should we start and proceed with our project with my group.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week we assigned different classes for each member and I started writing the JoinProject class. My code will be an addition to Elifnur's CreateProject and YourProjects classes which will complete the main menu interface.

### ~ 11.05.2020 ~
This week I kept working on the JoinProject class and except the database part, it is done. I will start working on the AccountSettings class primarily as the project is coming close to an end.
