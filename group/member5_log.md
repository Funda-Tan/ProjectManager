On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week I tried to get comfortable with Android Studio and shared my ideas on design.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week I was assigned with register page, administration page, and main activity classes. My register page codes will be combined with Cem's. I tried to plan my hierarchies and started to write my classes.

### ~ 13.05.2020 ~
This week I completed register page and administration page codes, and Cem will connect it to the database. I moved to writing the main activity classes. Hopefully I will quickly complete them.

### ~ 18.05.2020 ~
We recorded our presentation video together, I talked about the general idea of our project and the log in/sign up pages.

### ~ What did I learn? ~
This project was the opportunity for me learn how to use Android Studio, besides that I learned a bit about databases. I also learned how to work with other people's codes and how to combine them.
