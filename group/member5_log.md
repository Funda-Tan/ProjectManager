On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week I tried to get comfortable with Android Studio and shared my ideas on design.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week I was assigned with register page and main project page classes. My register page codes will be combined with Cem's. I tried to plan my hierarchies and started to write my classes.

### ~ 11.05.2020 ~
This week I completed register page codes and Cem will connect it to the database. I moved to writing the main project page classes. Hopefully I will quickly complete them.
