Reflections
  We found this project very useful in terms of a learning experience as it enabled us to work as a group, think as a group, and deciding 
as a group. We learned lots of things like using Android Studio, creating Firebase, and using it inside our project, designing interfaces, 
keeping track of what we did, etc. The difficult aspect was integrating each person's code but thanks to Github, we integrated what we did
into our project very easily. Also, Github was useful for keeping record of what we did, assigning classes to each person, and see what we
did in each meeting and each week.
