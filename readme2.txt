## Project Description
Our project "ProjectManager" is a simplified mobile management program. Our target demograpic is anyone who does not need management
systems aimed at corporate use. Each member can send messages privately, can upload assignment files, and create a project and invite
other people. The manager can also see the status of progress for each member, assign works, view the whole timeline of the planned work
on a calendar, and make changes in the project details.
